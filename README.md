This is a fork version of the serverless framework based on version 0.5.6.

Serverless is the application framework for building web, mobile and IoT applications exclusively on Amazon Web Services' Lambda and API Gateway. It's a command line interface that helps you build and maintain serverless apps across teams of any size.  It's also completely extensible via Plugins.  We believe AWS Lambda will be the focal point of the AWS cloud, and the Serverless Framework interprets AWS from Lambda's perspective.

## Getting Started

Install The Serverless Framework via npm: (requires Node V4)

```
npm install serverless-framework-0.56 -g
```

You can either install an existing project or create your own.  We recommend starting out with the [Serverless-Starter](https://www.github.com/serverless/serverless-starter)

```
serverless project install serverless-starter
```

Or you can create your own project

```
serverless project create
```

Refer to our [documentation](http://docs.serverless.com) for more info.  Enjoy!
