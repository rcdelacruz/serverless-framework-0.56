Before submitting a PR, please note the following:

[] Make sure that there's an issue opened that discuss this fix/feature. This is not required for simple PRs (ie. fixing a typo in README), but we just want to make sure you don't waste your time on a feature that we don't intend to support/maintain.
[] Make sure that you've tested your changes thoroughly.
[] If there are some side effects to your changes (whether positive or negative), please mention them in your PR so that we can discuss how to avoid them.


Above all, we thank you so much for your contribution! :)
